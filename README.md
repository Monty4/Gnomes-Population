## Description

Our team here at AXA is playing a fantasy role-playing game and every time the heroes they play arrive at a town, they have the issue they don't know the local population and what they can do to help them on their adventures. This is one of these times, our heroes just arrived at a Gnome town called Brastlewark. To facilitate trade with the local population they need an easy way to browse all the inhabitants details. We've found a server providing all the census data of Brastlewark at the following address:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrafols/mobile_test/master/data.json

Gnomes in this town are not really social because they have too much work to do. That's the reason they can have more than one job and might have few or even no friends at all. They also appreciate their privacy so they've used some random images from internet, not specifically optimized for mobile devices, for their profile. (They are very modern in some aspects and they have smartphones and access to internet for instance).

## Hints

- Be creative!.
- UI must not blocked by network connections or long operations.
- Use third party libraries for extended functionality.
- Snappiness & responsiveness over sluggishness & idleness.
- Determine gender of gnomes (just joking on this one but feel free to make your guess).
- Test the app!

## Personal API's and APP

- API Client: Retrieves data from URL
- Client APP: We render two components, Header and the Home. 
  - Header Component only shows de title.
  - Home Component allows to select the name of the Gnome and shows their image and characteristics on top, and their professions and friends on bottom.
